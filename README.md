Project Compute Canada Cluster: **Graham**
# Bugs
 - The original image size run out of memery. 320 works fine.

# TODO
- Train a U-Net with size 128 x 128 for 100 epochs (train size 100).
- Train a U-Net with size 320 x 320 for 100 epochs (train size 100).
- Divide images into 4.
- Create a data generator for training 


# Note
- `requirment.txt` didn't work on Compute Canada.
- model (run-30): trained with 100 320 x 320 images
